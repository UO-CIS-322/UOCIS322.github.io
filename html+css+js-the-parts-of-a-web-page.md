# The components of a web page

A web page as experienced by the user has three major components:  HTML that contains the structure and main content of the page, CSS that controls its presentation \(layout, typefaces, etc\), and JavaScript that provides interactivity.  In this chapter we describe how these three parts fit together.  Whole volumes have been written about each of the three components, so you won't find an encyclopedic reference here, but you will find enough basic information to get started and build web pages that incorporate all three elements.  Most importantly, you will have enough understanding of the principles underlying the design to help you find and integrate more details when you want to go beyond the basics.
