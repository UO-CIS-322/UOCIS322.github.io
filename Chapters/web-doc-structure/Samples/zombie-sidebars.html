<p class="precis">Like culinary fusion, zombie fusion offers
surprising combinations that work because of parallel elements
in their disparate sources.</p>

<p>All the great zombie movies contain an element of social
commentary.  A movie that combines a zombie element with another
genre or theme provides an opportunity to comment in a surprising
way, often with humor.</p>

<p>Among the movies that have fused a zombie element with
a more conventional movie about young people finding their
way in the world, <cite class="movie-title">Shaun of the Dead</cite>
and <cite class="movie-title">Night of the Comet</cite>
stand out for deadpan humor.  Shaun famously
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qHAOY7C1go">uses his
collection of vinyl records as weapons</a> while commenting on
which records are expendable and which should be kept.  (Dire Straits?
Throw it.)  In <cite class="movie-title">Night of the Comet</cite>,
which influenced the later <cite class="movie-title">Buffy the Vampire
Slayer</cite>, a recurring theme is the extent to which our world
has been automated and goes on without our direct involvement. 
</p>

<p>Merely mashing up genres is not enough, though.  Fusion cuisine
works because of parallels between culinary styles.  Yakisoba in place
of fettucine?  Might be interesting.  Citrus in place of vinegar?
Miso in place of parmesan?  It could work, but there is no guarantee.
A notable flop among zombie mash-ups was <cite
class="movie-title">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</cite>, a cute
concept that dulls after after a few battles.  Perhaps it
could have been made to work with a deeper and more nuanced
integration of the <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite> setting with
zombies as a critique of the English class system.  Simply using
zombies as <em>them</em>, a generic threatening <em>other</em>, is not
  enough. </p>
